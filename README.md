## Blackjack Games
  This is my first project at General Assembly. It is still need to improving code for more features. The rules of Blackjack can be grasped within minutes. However, depending on which variant you are playing, table rules and betting options may differ. There are a variety of Blackjack game types, since I have only one 1 week to finish my project , so I cut off several options, will update next versions on both Single Player and Multi-Player tables with some add-in features in the future.

### General Game Rules:
  Players are dealt a starting hand of 2 cards with the hopes of getting to the magical number of 21, or to get as close to 21 as possible. If a player gets 21 on his initial hand, it is called a “blackjack” or a “natural”. The player wins, unless the house reaches blackjack as well. The other ways to win are to hold a higher sum of cards at the end of the play than the house, or to have the house go over 21.The goal in any hand of Blackjack is to beat the dealer. To do this, you must have a hand that scores higher than the dealer’s hand, but does not exceed 21 in total value. Alternatively, you can win by having a score lower than 22 when the value of the dealer’s hand exceeds 21. When the total value of your hand is 22 or more, this is more commonly known as ‘busting’, and you will automatically lose .

### Game Play Options:
  Player will be presented with a number of decisions to make during each round of Blackjack. The decisions open to player will depend upon the cards player are dealt and the game variant player are playing. Here are the options traditionally in Blackjack:

  * Hit: Player can request additional cards to improve their hand(s). Cards will be drawn one at a time until the total hand value is 21 or higher.
  * Stand: When the total value of player’s hand is 21 or lower, and can choose to stand and not to risk the chance of thier hand(s exceeding 21 in total value.
